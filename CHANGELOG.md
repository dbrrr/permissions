## [0.1.2-SNAPSHOT] - 2016-10-15
### Changed
- Changed using keywords for domain, actions or entities to using plain strings.
  This creates less confusion and friction with db load/unload or use 
  across Clojure / Clojurescript.
- change atoms to store the role map and the resolvers from `defonce` to `def` so they could be
  easier used in a module.
